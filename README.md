# Projects Presentations
This repository contains the presentation of projects developed or still in development. The goal of these presentations is to give a deep insight in the projects from a high level perspective without worrying too much with the code. This is mostly to provide information on the tools, technologies involved and the breakthroughs attained.

##  π Vector GUI for Java and Android

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/%CF%80%20Vector%20GUI%20for%20Java%20and%20Android.md#%CF%80-vector-gui-for-java-and-android) is about the development of a system for creating  Graphics User Interfaces (GUI) for Java applications on Windows, Linux or Android using vector primitives and vectorized fonts.

## Automatic Vector Fonts Generator Project – Glyphs, their widths and kerning pairs

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/Automatic%20Vector%20Fonts%20Generator%20Project.md#automatic-vector-fonts-generator-project--glyphs-their-widths-and-kerning-pairs) is about the development of a tool to transform **Truetype** and **Opentype** fonts to an embedded proprietary compact font format in Java.

## String Vectorizer Project

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/String%20Vectorizer.md#string-vectorizer-project) is about a program that vectorizes strings into Java Path2D.Float paths.

## BreakIntoLines Project

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/BreakIntoLines.md#breakintolines) is about a Java 
program that vectorizes a string into Java Path2D.Float paths, breaking it into lines and right justifying the text.
