# Projects Presentations
This repository contains the presentation of projects developed or still in development. The goal of these presentations is to give a deep insight in the projects from a high level perspective without worrying too much with the code. This is mostly to provide information on the tools, technologies involved and the breakthroughs attained.

##  π Vector GUI for Java and Android

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/%CF%80%20Vector%20GUI%20for%20Java%20and%20Android.md#%CF%80-vector-gui-for-java-and-android) is about the development of a system for creating  Graphics User Interfaces (GUI) for Java applications on Windows, Linux or Android using vector primitives and vectorized fonts.

## MicroVBA
This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint) implements a VBA interpreter written in VBA to be used in PowerPoint in order to be able to import large vector graphics files. The advantages are: vectorization of PowerPoint objects (particularly vectorized texts), high level solution to convert from other vector graphics formats, portable way to store vector graphics objects outside PowerPoint, smooth connectivity with VBA programs already inside PowerPoint presentations, simple programmable solution for complex objects construction, no limitations in the size of the files and more pertinent and helpful error messages. It actually does not need full VBA conpatibility, since it can smoothly integrate with VBA programs in the Powerpoint presentation.

## PDFBox
This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/PDFBox) offers several versions of PDFBox source code that can be directly compiled with Eclipse without using Maven. The source code version used here is `pdfbox-2.0.23`. The complete version (PDFBox-Complete) is a complete unmodified PDFBox with all packages. In the [README file]() it is shown how to compile, run the examples, and use the PDF debugger to check PDF files contents. This project will contribute to the project [π Vector GUI for Java and Android](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/%CF%80%20Vector%20GUI%20for%20Java%20and%20Android.md#%CF%80-vector-gui-for-java-and-android). 
Currently it is used to automatically format texts into a book in PDF. As a test file a housemade web aspirator was developed to extract boooks from a web site. These project do not yet appear in this repository.

## Automatic Vector Fonts Generator Project – Glyphs, their widths and kerning pairs

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/Automatic%20Vector%20Fonts%20Generator%20Project.md#automatic-vector-fonts-generator-project--glyphs-their-widths-and-kerning-pairs) is about the development of a tool to transform **Truetype** and **Opentype** fonts to an embedded proprietary compact font format in Java.

## String Vectorizer Project

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/String%20Vectorizer.md#string-vectorizer-project) is about a program that vectorizes strings into Java Path2D.Float paths.

## BreakIntoLines Project

This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Projects-Presentations/blob/main/BreakIntoLines.md#breakintolines) is about a Java 
program that vectorizes a string into Java Path2D.Float paths, breaking it into lines and right justifying the text.

## Converting PostScript to Java
This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/PostScript/tree/main/Examples/Convertion%20to%20Java/ExclamationIcon#exclamationicon) shows how to convert PostScript files into Java classes semi-automatically.

## Java Vector GUI
This [project](https://github.com/nilostolte/Java-Vector-GUI/tree/main/MenuInfographics6#menuinfographics6) shows how a vector GUI can be coded. This code has been used for other projects like in [MicroVBA](https://github.com/nilostolte/MicroVBA-PowerPoint).
